# EventMaintenanceDemo

**EventMaintenanceDemo** is a demonstration project showcasing the framework of an **EventServer**.
It does not include any network or database functionality, but focuses solely on how to manage in-game events for online games.
The demo provides several methods to handle situations that a real EventServer might encounter — including adding or removing events while the server is running, modifying event schedules, and offering tools to test and verify event timing behavior.
